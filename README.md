# MorseCommunication
A morse bidirectional communication device using Arduino

This device is created using two Arduino Uno. The messages are sent in a bidirectional way, from one Arduino to another, using nRF24L01 interfacing. The encoded messages are introduced and sent using buttons. There are 3 buttons in this order: delete message, send message, introduce message. A LED is used to sense the impulse when using the button for introducing the text.

TO DO: Add LCD for displaying the messages.
